## About the Project
Project X is basically a **skibidi-coded Sigma pipeline**.  
It’s giving:  
- Data scraping with **max rizz**  
- ML models that either clutch or flop (no in-between)  
- Dashboards pulling up like “you dropped this”  
- Deployed faster than a gyatt in Ohio  

In short: **Project X is a 67/10, no cap.**

## Features (built diff)
- Dashboards: skibidi interactive  
- ML Models: certified rizz (sometimes NPC-coded tho)  
- APIs: pulling data straight outta Ohio  
- NLP: extracting sigma vibes from text  
- Real-time alerts: “bro you in danger”  
- Dark mode: cuz light mode has no rizz

## Tech Stack (Sigma 67 Edition)
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (skibidi UI), Plotly (gyatt charts)  
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Ohio-coded)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (actually cooked)  
- **ML:** PyTorch + Hugging Face (straight rizz models)  
- **Deployment:** Docker + Hugging Face (no NPC energy here)

## FAQ
**Q: Why does the app sometimes skibidi crash?**  
A: Because it’s coded in Ohio.  

**Q: Is this production-ready?**  
A: Bro it’s giving “67 beta release.”  

**Q: How do I contribute?**  
A: Drop some sigma rizz in a PR.
